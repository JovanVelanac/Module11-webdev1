Websites are a big part of my mife. To me they come as a blank sheet,
awaiting for your imagination and your own style to be fill it. It is
a type of modern art to me.
I like to make websites, I am not so creative, but I enjoy seeing my
code work like its supposed to. For me, as mentioned in the "My website
is a shifting house...", for me they are thunderstorms, where I gather 
an inspiration and make a website quickly, then move onto the next project.
I feel very fortunate to find something to do that I love.
Websites have an infinite amount of functions, they can bring people together,
they can, and mostly do share information, it is an art and used to express 
oneself. Making websites also makes a person feel fulfilled, and like the 
day has served a great purpose, and when you see your work on the web, it 
becomes timeless, always on the web, always going to be remembered, you leave
a piece of you drifting forever, that generations can see, that other worlds,
may some day see.
